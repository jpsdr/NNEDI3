INFO:

      nnedi3 is an intra-field only deinterlacer. It takes in a frame, throws away one field, and
   then interpolates the missing pixels using only information from the kept field. It has same
      rate and double rate modes, and works with all planar modes, YUY2, RGB32 (avs+ only) and RGB24 input.
      Note : Only 8 bits input is supported.
       nnedi3 is also very good for enlarging images by powers of 2, and includes a function
                                  'nnedi3_rpow2' for that purpose.

                 bool sleep, int prefetch, int range,int ThreadLevel)



PARAMETERS (nnedi3):


   field -

      Controls the mode of operation (double vs same rate) and which field is kept.
      Possible settings:

         -2 = double rate (alternates each frame), uses avisynth's internal parity value to start
         -1 = same rate, uses avisynth's internal parity value
          0 = same rate, keep bottom field
          1 = same rate, keep top field
          2 = double rate (alternates each frame), starts with bottom
          3 = double rate (alternates each frame), starts with top

      If field is set to -1, then nnedi3 calls child->GetParity(0) during initialization.
      If it returns true, then field is set to 1. If it returns false, then field is set to 0.
      If field is set to -2, then the same thing happens, but instead of setting field to 1
      or 0 it is set to 3 or 2.

      Default:  -1  (int)


   dh -

      Doubles the height of the input. Each line of the input is copied to every other line
      of the output and the missing lines are interpolated. If field=0, the input is copied
      to the odd lines of the output. If field=1, the input is copied to the even lines of
      the output. field must be set to either -1, 0, or 1 when using dh=true.

      Default:  false  (int)


   Y, U, V, A -

      These control whether or not the specified plane is processed. Set to true to
      process or false to ignore. Ignored planes are not copied, zero'd, or even
      considered. So what the ignored planes happen to contain on output is unpredictable.
      The A parameter for the alpha channel has effect only on avs+.
      For RGB24 input Y=B, U=G, V=R.
      For RGB32 input Y=G, U=B, V=R (avs+ only).

      Default:  Y = true  (bool)
                U = true  (bool)
                V = true  (bool)
                A = true  (bool)


   nsize -

      Sets the size of the local neighborhood around each pixel that is used by the predictor
      neural network. Possible settings (x_diameter x y_diameter):

          0 -   8x6
          1 -  16x6
          2 -  32x6
          3 -  48x6
          4 -   8x4
          5 -  16x4
          6 -  32x4

      For image enlargement it is recommended to use 0 or 4. Larger y_diameter settings
      will result in sharper output. For deinterlacing larger x_diameter settings will
      allow connecting lines of smaller slope. However, what setting to use really
      depends on the amount of aliasing (lost information) in the source. If the source was
      heavily low-pass filtered before interlacing then aliasing will be low and a large
      x_diameter setting wont be needed, and vice versa.

      Default:  6  (int)


   nns -

      Sets the number of neurons in the predictor neural network. Possible settings are
      0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. 0 is fastest. 4 is slowest, but should give the best quality. This
      is a quality vs speed option; however, differences are usually small. The difference
      in speed will become larger as 'qual' is increased.

         0 - 16
         1 - 32
         2 - 64
         3 - 128
         4 - 256

      Default:  1  (int)


   qual -

      Controls the number of different neural network predictions that are blended together
      to compute the final output value. Each neural network was trained on a different set
      of training data. Blending the results of these different networks improves generalization
      to unseen data. Possible values are 1 or 2. Essentially this is a quality vs speed
      option. Larger values will result in more processing time, but should give better results.
      However, the difference is usually pretty small. I would recommend using qual>1 for
      things like single image enlargement.

      Default:  1  (int)


   etype -

      Controls which set of weights to use in the predictor nn. Possible settings:

           0 - weights trained to minimize absolute error
           1 - weights trained to minimize squared error

      Default:  0  (int)


   pscrn -

      Controls whether or not the prescreener neural network is used to decide which pixels
      should be processed by the predictor neural network and which can be handled by simple
      cubic interpolation. The prescreener is trained to know whether cubic interpolation
      will be sufficient for a pixel or whether it should be predicted by the predictor nn.
      The computational complexity of the prescreener nn is much less than that of the predictor
      nn. Since most pixels can be handled by cubic interpolation, using the prescreener
      generally results in much faster processing. The prescreener is pretty accurate, so the
      difference between using it and not using it is almost always unnoticeable.

      Version 0.9.3 adds a new, faster prescreener with three selectable 'levels', which
      trade off the number of pixels detected as only requiring cubic interpolation versus
      incurred error. Therefore, pscrn is now an integer with possible values of 0, 1, 2, 3,
      and 4.

         0 - no prescreening (same as false in prior versions)
         1 - original prescreener (same as true in prior versions)
         2 - new prescreener level 0 (<=16 bits only, otherwise go back to 1)
         3 - new prescreener level 1 (<=16 bits only, otherwise go back to 1)
         4 - new prescreener level 2 (<=16 bits only, otherwise go back to 1)

          ** Higher levels for the new prescreener result in cubic interpolation being
             used on fewer pixels (so are slower, but incur less error). However, the
             difference is pretty much unnoticable. Level 2 is closest to the original
             prescreener in terms of incurred error, but is much faster.
        
      Default:  2  (int)


   threads -

      Controls how many threads will be used for processing. If set to 0, threads will
      be set equal to the number of detected logical or physical cores,according logicalCores parameter.

      Default:  0  (int)


   opt -

      Sets which cpu optimizations to use. Possible settings:

         0 = auto detect
         1 = use c
         2 = use sse2
         3 = use sse4.1
         4 = use AVX
         5 = use AVX2
         6 = use FMA3
         7 = use FMA4

        ** for an older version supporting sse use v0.9.1 available at:
        **    http://bengal.missouri.edu/~kes25c/old_stuff/

      Default:  0 (int)


   fapprox -

      Bitmask which enables or disables certain speed-ups. Value range is [0,15].
      Mainly for debugging.

           0 = nothing
          &1 = use int16 dot products in first layer of prescreener nn (<=16 bits only)
          &2 = use int16 dot products in predictor nn (<=15 bits only)
  &12 =    4 = use exp function approximation in predictor nn
  &12 = 8|12 = use faster (and more inaccurate) exp function approximation in predictor nn

      Default:  15 (int)


   logicalCores -

      If threads is set to 0, it will specify if the number of threads will be the number
      of logical CPU (true) or the number of physical cores (false). If your processor doesn't
      have hyper-threading or threads<>0, this parameter has no effect.

      Default: true (bool)

   MaxPhysCore -

      If true, the threads repartition will use the maximum of physical cores possible. If your
      processor doesn't have hyper-threading or the SetAffinity parameter is set to false,
      this parameter has no effect.

      Default: true (bool)

   SetAffinity -

      If this parameter is set to true, the pool of threads will set each thread to a specific core,
      according the status of previous parameters. If set to false, it's leaved to the OS.
      If prefecth>number of physical cores, it's automaticaly set to false.

      Default: false (bool)

  sleep -
      If this parameter is set to true, once the filter has finished one frame, the threads of the
      threadpool will be suspended (instead of still running but waiting an event), and resume when
      the next frame will be processed. If set to false, the threads of the threadpool are always
      running and waiting for a start event even between frames.

      Default: false (bool)

  prefetch - (added negative trim feature)
      This parameter will allow to create more than one threadpool, to avoid mutual resources acces
      if "prefetch" is used in the avs script.
      0 : Will set automaticaly to the prefetch value use in the script. Well... that's what i wanted
          to do, but for now it's not possible for me to get this information when i need it, so, for
          now, 0 will result in 1. For now, if you're using "prefetch" in your script, put the same
          value on this parameter.

      Default: 0

  range -
      This parameter specify the range the output video data has to comply with.
      Limited range is 16-235 for Y, 16-240 for U/V. Full range is 0-255 for all planes.
      Alpha channel is not affected by this paramter, it's always full range.
      Values are adjusted according bit depth of course. This parameter has no effect
      for float datas.
      0 : Automatic mode. If video is YUV mode is limited range, if video is RGB mode is
          full range, if video is greyscale (Y/Y8) mode is Y limited range.
      1 : Force full range whatever the video is.
      2 : Force limited Y range for greyscale video (Y/Y8), limited range for YUV video,
          no effect for RGB video.
      3 : Force limited U/V range for greyscale video (Y/Y8), limited range for YUV video,
          no effect for RGB video.
      4 : Force special camera range (16-255) for greyscale video (Y/Y8) and YUV video,
          no effect for RGB video.

      Default: 1

  ThreadLevel -
      This parameter will set the priority level of the threads created for the processing (internal
      multithreading). No effect if threads=1.
      1 : Idle level.
      2 : Lowest level.
      3 : Below level.
      4 : Normal level.
      5 : Above level.
      6 : Highest level.
      7 : Time critical level (WARNING !!! use this level at your own risk)

      Default : 6

The logicalCores, MaxPhysCore, SetAffinity and sleep are parameters to specify how the pool of thread
will be created and handled, allowing if necessary each people to tune according his configuration.


PARAMETERS (nnedi3_rpow2):


   rfactor -

      Image enlargement factor. Must be a power of 2 in the range [2,1024].

      Default:  not set  (int)


   cshift -

      Sets the resizer used for correcting the image center shift that nnedi3_rpow2
      introduces. This can be any of Avisynth's internal resizers, such as "spline36resize",
      "lanczosresize", etc... If not specified the shift is not corrected. The correction
      is accomplished by using the subpixel cropping capability of Avisynth's internal
      resizers.

      Default:  not set  (string)


   fwidth/fheight -
   
      If correcting the image center shift by using the 'cshift' parameter, fwidth/fheight
      allow you to set a new output resolution. First, the image is enlarged by 'rfactor'
      using nnedi3. Once that is completed the image center shift is corrected, and the
      image is resampled to fwidth x fheight resolution. The shifting and resampling
      happen in one call using the internal Avisynth resizer you specify via the 'cshift'
      string. If fwidth/fheight are not specified, then they are set equal to rfactor*width
      and rfactor*height respectively (in other words they do nothing).

      Default:  not set  (int)
                not set  (int)


   ep0/ep1 -

      Some Avisynth resizers take optional arguments, such as 'taps' for lanczosresize or
      'p' for gaussresize. ep0/ep1 allow you to pass values for these optional arguments
      when using the 'cshift' parameter. If the resizer only takes one optional argument
      then ep0 is used. If the argument that the resizer takes is not a float value,
      then ep0 gets rounded to an integer. If the resizer takes two optional arguments,
      then ep0 corresponds to the first one, and ep1 corresponds to the second. The only
      resizer that takes more than one optional argument is bicubicresize(), which takes
      'b' and 'c'. So ep0 = b, and ep1 = c. If ep0/ep1 are not set then the default value
      for the optional argument(s) of the resizer is used.

      Default:  not set  (float)
                not set  (float)


   nsize/nns/qual/etype/pscrn/threads/opt/fapprox/logicalCores/MaxPhysCore/SetAffinity/
   sleep/prefetch/range -

      Same as corresponding parameters in nnedi3. However, nnedi3_rpow2 uses nsize=0 and
      nns=3 by default (versus nsize=6 and nns=1 in nnedi3()).
     
   csresize
     
      Chroma Shift Resize. This parameter enable (true) or disable (false) the chroma shift
      adjustment according the resize. If disabled, no shift is made on chroma according the
      resize and/or the colorspace, and the [mpeg2] parameter has not effect. If true, adjustment
      on chroma shift is made according the color space and the resize. YV16 is always shifted
      because it's always MPEG-2 subsampling, YV411 is never shifted, and YV12 is ruled by the
      [mpeg2] parameter.
      
      Default: True

   mpeg2
     
      Specify chroma alignment for YV12. If true, chroma subsampling follow MPEG-2
      alignment, and a shift correction is made on the chroma according the resize.
      If false, chroma subsampling for YV12 is MPEG-1, and so no shift is made.
      
      Default: True

   threads_rs -

      threads parameter for the multithreaded resamplers if they are used, otherwise no effect.

      Default:  0  (int)

   logicalCores_rs -

      logicalCores parameter for the multithreaded resamplers if they are used, otherwise no effect.

      Default:  true  (bool)

   MaxPhysCore_rs -

      MaxPhysCore parameter for the multithreaded resamplers if they are used, otherwise no effect.

      Default:  true  (bool)

   SetAffinity_rs -

      SetAffinity parameter for the multithreaded resamplers if they are used, otherwise no effect.

      Default:  true  (bool)
